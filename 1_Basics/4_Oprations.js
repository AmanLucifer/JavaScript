let valueofNumber = 3

//There is no Complux in this code .
//So Now we know about not high important code.

console.log(2+2);
console.log(2-2);
console.log(2*2);
console.log(2**4); //the meaning of the code is power.
console.log(2/2);
console.log(2%2);
//so much easy calculation code.

//Adding two string 
let srt1 = "Hii"
let str2 = " Aman" //we use space after Aman for space between Hii Aman.
let str3 = srt1 + str2

console.log(str3);


// its a conversion 

console.log(1 + "2");
console.log("1" + 2);
console.log("1" + 2 + 3);
console.log(1 + 2 + "3");

// 1 + "2" ==>  12
// "1" + 2 ==>  12
// "1" + 2 + 3 ==> 123
// 1 + 2 + "3" ==> 33


// it is also a conversion 

console.log(true);    //true
console.log(+true);   //1
console.log(+"");     //0
//we add + symbole so the output come in the  number from 
//but is is not perfect

let gameScore = 200
++gameScore;
console.log(gameScore);

//I am not prefere to learn this code so much 
//You have to Learn about prefix and postfix in java mdn.
